With its closeness to John-Wayne Airport, the Santa Ana freeway, and the beach, it's a perfect place to raise a family. With an average household size of 4.3 and over half of houses being owned by at least one married couple, dog breeders have taken an interest in setting up their business somewhere within the city to get those families the forever friend that would complete their household."

Beagles are a social breed that require plenty of exercise as well as face-to-face time with other dogs. They get along extremely well with children, and prefer households with multiple people so they don't feel lonely. The client wants to move to a neighborhood where:\n* the household size is large\n    * (so the beagles have company)\n* the mean age is low\n    * (so the owners have energy)\n* there are multiple parks and/or beaches\n    * (so the beagles have places they can run around/meet other dogs)\n* there are plenty of veterinarians\n    * (so it's clear that the beagles will be cared for and that there are other pets in the area)\n* there are groomers\n    * (so the owners can pamper the beagles)\n\nThe ideal neighborhood will have an even balance of all these characteristics so the breeders give the beagles adequate stimulation while they raise them and be assured that local owners will also have access to facilities necessary for caring for the dog."
