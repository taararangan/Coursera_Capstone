Beagles are a social breed that require plenty of exercise as well as face-to-face time with other dogs. The client wants to move to a neighborhood where there are pet stores nearby so it's easy to provide for their dogs, as well as many open-air public spaces where the dogs can socialize and get their daily exercise.\n\nThe ideal neighborhood will have an even balance of all these characteristics so the breeders can give the beagles adequate stimulation while they raise them as well as \"advertise\" their dogs to locals when they take them for walks. Adopting their dogs out locally will also assure that potential owners will have access to the same facilities  as the breeders that are necessary for caring for the dog."

Given beagles' need for activity and socialization, we tried to find desirable neighborhoods by looking for neighborhoods near places with parks and open-air venues where the beagles could get activity, socialize with people, and meet potential new owners. We also tried to find nearby pet stores to make it easier to get the resources necessary to care for each dog. After creating a dataframe containing neighborhoods' zip codes and location, we used the Foursquare API to call nearby venues, then cleaned the dataframe to include only the dog-friendly ones. We also eliminated venues with limited variety of venues since the dogs and the owners benefit from variation. Finally, we clustered the remaining neighborhoods by similar characteristics and mapped them, revealing that the neighborhoods with variety were in the east bay, which is closer to tourist districts. Two clusters showed proximity to many open-air venues. Chinatown showed that it encompassed two zip codes in different clusters, and featured additional proximity to a pet store, which would be useful for furnishing the beagles with necessary toys, food, and bedding. We concluded that Chinatown is the best place to set up a dog-breeding business in San Francisco."
